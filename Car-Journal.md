- Have not heard back from Josh yet.
- I am leaning towards Miata bc it is fun and financing is good.
- If I can drive it during the weekdays, I think I will be happy. 
- Will I need to pickup Paul during the weekdays? Who is taking Paul to school in Sept? Will Mom be here or SPHO? or Me?

## 04-17-23
- Didn't get series white STI this weekend. Surprising there is 1 in Montana 8hrs away for the same price. and 1 in Arizona with more mileage. I am curious to see how long those will last
- This weekend is also not good to buy bc of spa day and there is no childcare for Paul. What should Paul and I do in the morning?
- Go to someone's house? Ian, Kenny, Molly and Ethan. David Wang? 
- Interest rates are going up, but it still seems like they are selling.
- The white STI in Sacremento is still available.
- Not sure if remodel is going to happen for a while bc Wilma feels insecure about her job...

## On a rainy day, will I want to drive a soft top miata or gr86?
- Miata won't be fun on a rainy day 

## [04-07-23] Seems like there are lots of STIs available in SoCal? 
1. should I travel?
2. should I pay cash?
3. can I negotiate?
4. what is the total?
5. should I try to get less than 40k? 
6. seems like cars are not selling

## Should I get a Model-Y?
- It will be available in the future
- Price discount is $7500

## Series White STI steps
1. replace exhaust or credit me some money
2. buy it next Sat In Bellevue or Renton
3. oil change check
4. CarFax report
5. get Progressive insurance before I buy
6. Call chase for process and setup appointment.
7. meet at Chase bank. Do I need cashier's check or do I just do wire transfer routing?
8. make sure to send the title to my address
9. get the title in my name
10. go to DMV in issquah and pay 4k tax, check or credit card? 
11. get tags
12. done

* Considering a series white sti. Not sure what the price should be. Maybe 45k is too much.
* I should go test drive some tomorrow.
