John 4:13–15

[13] Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 
[14] but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. 


The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” 
[15] The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.” (ESV)
