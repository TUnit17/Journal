## Ford Projects $3 Billion Loss on EV Business for 2023


- expects to lose about $3 billion on its electric-vehicle business this year, a reminder of how far traditional auto makers have to go in turning their EV portfolios profitable. 
-  Ford today sells three electric vehicles in North America, its largest market: the F-150 Lightning pickup truck, the Mustang Mach-E SUV and a plug-in cargo van.
-  while outlining a new financial-reporting structure intended to give investors better insight into the performance of its three business units: 
1. Model e, its EV business;
2.  Ford Blue, the traditional part of the company that sells internal-combustion-engine vehicles; and 
3.  Ford Pro, its sizable commercial-vehicle division.
- auto maker also reiterated the forecast it originally issued in early February of $9 billion to $11 billion in operating profit this year companywide. (This means even though the EV division will lose 3B, as a while the Ford Company will make 11B)

- Colin Langan, a Wells Fargo automotive analyst, said the outlook was worse than the firm’s forecast of $6,000 per vehicle on a variable-cost basis. He added that it was unclear how Ford would achieve its 8% margin target for the EV division by 2026.
- “This implies [battery-electric vehicles] are currently losing money on each model sold, rather than covering any fixed costs,” he wrote in a note Thursday.
- Tesla lost money for more than a decade before it began posting consistent profits in recent years. Last year, its operating margin was 16.8%.
- FORD CEO, Mr. Farley last year separated the company’s electric-vehicle business from the part that works on gas-and-diesel-engine vehicles, a strategy he said would allow Ford to move faster as it targets the rapidly growing global market for battery-powered cars.
- Historically, Ford has reported profit-and-loss by regions. Now it will break out results for each of the three new business units, rather than providing regional results. Ford said it would use the revised reporting for the first time when it posts its first-quarter financial results, scheduled for May 2.

- Mr. Lawler attributed the mounting losses to investments Ford is making to increase EV production in coming years, including construction of two new battery-cell factories in Kentucky and a third in Tennessee, along with a new plant to make EV trucks. 

- The traditional Ford Blue business, dominated by sales of its highly profitable F Series pickup trucks, posted operating profit of $6.8 billion last year, more than double that of 2021, when a semiconductor shortage hurt vehicle output.

- The company said its Ford Pro division, which sells pickups, vans and other vehicles to general contractors, landscaping companies and other commercial buyers, posted $3.2 billion in operating profit last year.
- Ford said it is on target to reach an annualized production rate of 2 million electric vehicles by the end of 2026.
