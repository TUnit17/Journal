## How do I enter a backdoor Roth IRA conversion?

- A backdoor Roth IRA allows you to get around income limits by converting a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Contributing directly to a Roth IRA is restricted if your income is beyond certain limits, but there are no income limits for conversions.

- You’ll receive a Form 1099-R with code 2 in box 7 (or code 7 if your age is over 59 ½) in the year you make your Roth conversion. You should report your conversion for the year you receive this 1099-R:

- If you received this form in 2022, complete both steps below to report it on your 2022 taxes
If you'll receive this form in 2023, wait to report it on your 2023 taxes. In this case, only complete Step 1 below for your 2022 taxes. You’ll complete both steps next year when filing your taxes for 2023

- Doing a backdoor Roth conversion is a two-step process.
