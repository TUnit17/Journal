# 2Thes 1
2 Thessalonians 1:5–8

[5] This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering—[6] since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, [7] and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels [8] in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. (ESV)

## Word of encouragement
- Suffering for God means you are considered worthy of the kingdom of God.
- Relief from suffering comes when the Lord Jesus returns with his angels
- Jesus will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey
